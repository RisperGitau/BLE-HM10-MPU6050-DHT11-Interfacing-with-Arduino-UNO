# BLE-HM10-MPU6050-DHT11-Interfacing-with-Arduino-UNO
BLE HM10 , MPU6050 , DHT11  Interfacing with Arduino UNO. 
This project was transmitting temperature and humidity data read from the dht 11 sensor via BLE HM10 module.
The MPU6050 gyroscope and accelerometer readings are also transmitted by the HM10 BLE module.
The sensors are interfaced with arduino UNO.
